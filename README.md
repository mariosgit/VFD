# VFD

A collection of upcycling projects for Vakuum Fluorescent Displays (VFD). These are Display as you may find in Audio/Video gear like CD/DVD players. A VFD requires high voltage to control anodes and gates, and a small AC voltage for the fillament(heater). To drive each single display element, a time multiplexed controller is required.

Some interesting plain VFDs, that means VFD without driver circuits, are available at pollin.de, they have mixed sets and a bunch of single 7 segment displays.

### VFD_TPIC_Test

### VFD_MN12832JC

Works! Just mind the signal level gap, use a level shifter or bring down VDD1 to ~4.3V (diode), high is specified as 80% of VDD1. When turning down VDD1 the display will transition from eratic to clean.

## PCBs

PCB-Eagle contains one for the MN12832JC + all the power supply.

### Status

See README in subdirectories.

### Comments

At the moment I use Eagle (also playing with conversion to KiCAD 5..)

The folder PCB-Eagle contains my library with
- The displays
- The chips used (XL6009, ZXBM5210)

The folder PCB-Eagle-Blocks contains some design blocks which can be dropped in a PCB project.
- For the power converter

They all use a similar net naming
- +5V
- VPP for the 50V anode voltage
- F1 and F2 for the fillament AC voltage

The ZIP file is a set of production files.
